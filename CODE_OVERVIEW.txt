INTERIOR_DESIGN.CPP – WALKTHROUGH
=================================

1. Global State & Helpers
-------------------------
- Animation variables track angles (lamp, fan, clock), waves, particle positions, and smart-panel pulses.
- Algorithms implemented:
  • drawLineDDA: digital differential analyzer for general-purpose lines.
  • drawLineBresenham: integer-based lines (lamp cord, bookshelf supports).
  • drawCircleMidpoint: pixel-outline circles (clock rings, cup rim).
  • drawFilledCircle: GL_TRIANGLE_FAN helper for discs/LEDs.
  • drawGradientRect/drawRect: thin wrappers around GL_QUADS.
- HSV→RGB converter provides smooth rainbow colors for the smart panel.

2. Room & Static Geometry
-------------------------
- drawRoom paints wall/floor gradients and wood grain (DDA lines).
- drawDesk/drawChair/drawBookshelf use rectangles and DDA/Bresenham accents.
- drawBooks demonstrates DDA spines and stacked quads for scaling practice.
- drawPrinter, drawComputer, drawKeyboard, drawPicture add desktop props.

3. Animated Features
--------------------
- drawLamp (assigned to Zisan) uses glTranslatef/glRotatef to swing around a pivot; cord relies on Bresenham.
- drawSmartPanel (Farhan) draws a framed control UI, HSV music bars, Wi-Fi arcs, and a touch button that scales with glScalef.
- drawClock (Farhan) layers Midpoint Circle outlines and animates second/minute/hour hands plus pendulum motion.
- drawCeilingFan (Zisan) builds blades with GL_QUADS, then translates to the hub and rotates by fanAngle.
- drawCoffeeCup adds DDA-based steam lines; drawDeskOrganizer places pens via Bresenham/DDA mixes.

4. Display & Animation Loop
---------------------------
- display() clears the frame, then draws background → wall elements → furniture → animated features in correct z-order.
- update() (timer every 8ms) computes deltaTime, advances all animations (lamp angle, fan angle, clock hands, pendulum, glowPhase, screenWave, particleY, smartPanelGlow/music bars), and triggers redisplay.
- init() sets clear color, orthographic projection (0–800, 0–500), enables smoothing/blending for soft edges.
- keyboard() handles Esc/Quit, reset (R), and manual fan nudge (F).
- main() wires GLUT callbacks: display, keyboard, timer.

5. Algorithms-to-Feature Mapping Summary
----------------------------------------
- Farhan: Midpoint Circle (clock bezel, pendulum caps), rotation for hands.
- Zisan: Bresenham lines (lamp cord) + rotation transforms (lamp swing, fan).
- Soroar: DDA lines (books, desk dividers) + smart-panel scaling pulse.
